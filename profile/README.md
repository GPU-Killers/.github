## Code signing
All commits made to company repos are **REQUIRED** to be signed. We have two top-level signitures used. The order of the signitures go as followed:

`GPU Killers Master Key <admin@sparty18.me> --> Developer Key <coding@sparty182020.anonaddy.com> --> All User Keys`

Public keys for both the core master and dev keys can be found on [OpenPGP Keyserver](https://keys.openpgp.org). Links:
- - [GPU Killers Master Key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/357252F3FD7D1B6C3455A44DC332B28605B7EFE1) (PGP Key ID: `C332 B286 05B7 EFE1`)

To verify a signiture, download and import the both the Master and the Developer keys along with the user's signing key and run `gpg --check-signitures` and confirm all the signitures match up properly. If **ANY** of them cannot be verified or are bad signitures not matching the provided pattern, the key and therefor the user cannot be trusted. All members with active commits with have their PGP Key IDs provided on the readme
